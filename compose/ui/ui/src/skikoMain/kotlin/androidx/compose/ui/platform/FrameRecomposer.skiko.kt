/**
 * Owns a [Recomposer] and frame clock shared by one or more scenes hosted by the same platform
 * container - the non-Android analog of Android's host-side recomposer/frame-clock machinery
 * (`AndroidComposeView` + the host recomposer + `Choreographer`).
 *
 * Two work queues mirror `AndroidUiDispatcher`'s two queues:
 * - [effectDispatcher] (Android's `toRunTrampolined`): coroutine dispatch, composition effects
 *   (`LaunchedEffect`, `rememberCoroutineScope` launches) and the recomposer's effect context;
 * - [recomposeDispatcher] (Android's `toRunOnFrame`), together with [frameClock]: `withFrameNanos`
 *   awaiters and recomposition (the recomposition loop runs on `recomposeDispatcher + frameClock`).
 *
 * Both are [FlushCoroutineDispatcher]s layered over the host's real dispatcher, so on a host with a
 * live native loop they drain automatically (like Android's `Handler.post`); [performFrame] and the
 * scene phases also drain them explicitly via [performScheduledEffects] /
 * [performScheduledRecomposerTasks].
 *
 * Android drives frames through `Choreographer.doFrame`; non-Android platforms have no such hook,
 * so the host calls [performFrame] explicitly before driving scene measure/layout and draw.
 *
 * The host dispatcher must be confined to a single thread, so [composeThreadId] is stable.
 * It is recorded whenever the recomposer runs on the host thread (via [performFrameDispatch]).
